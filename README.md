Simple Raspberry Pi Phone

# Notes
Should go with either the SIM7100a or the SIM7600a.  I'm not able to find one that comes already
soldered to a breakout.  I can find just the chip on Ebay or AliExpress.  

## Audio
If I order just the chip, maybe the audio breakout could work with a WT588D chip...?
See page 36 (section 3.6.2) of the SIM7000 hardware doc.

## SIM
docs say to protect it with an "ESD". Will need to figure out how to wire that in.

## Python
